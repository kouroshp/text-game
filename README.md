# text-game

This is a very simple text based game engine written in C, inspired by the likes of [Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure) and the [Legend of Drongo](https://github.com/joevandebilt/Legend-Of-Drongo).

## Building
Ensure you have a C compiler (`clang`, `gcc`) and `make` installed, then simply execute `make` in the directory of the project:

    make
    ./text-game
