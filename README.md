# text-game

This is a very simple text based game engine written in C, inspired by the likes of [Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure) and the [Legend of Drongo](https://github.com/joevandebilt/Legend-Of-Drongo).

## Building

If you're using a Unix-like operating system (e.g. OS X, Linux, BSD), just execute the build script (assuming you've already changed into the directory):

    ./build.sh
    bin/text-game

If you're using Windows, just look at `build.sh` and run the commands manually.
